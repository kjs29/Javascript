When I come across a difficult coding question, I have two choices, 

1. Working on it for a long time, like days, or 

2. working on it for 15 mins and look at the answer. 

What is better for my overal coding programming skill in the future?

  When facing a difficult coding question, it's always tempting to either spend an extended period of time working on it or just give up and look for the answer right away. However, neither of these options is ideal for improving your overall coding and programming skills.

  If you spend too much time on a single problem, you might get stuck in the same way of thinking and not learn anything new. On the other hand, if you rely too heavily on looking up answers, you may never develop the problem-solving skills necessary to tackle complex problems on your own.

  A better approach would be to set a time limit for yourself, say 30 minutes or an hour, and see how far you can get. If you make progress, great! Keep working on it until you solve it. If you get stuck, take a break, come back to it later with a fresh perspective, and try again. Repeat this process until you either solve the problem or determine that it's beyond your current skill level.

  If you still can't solve it, then it's okay to look at the answer or ask for help. But don't just copy and paste the solution - try to understand how it works and what concepts you can learn from it.

  In summary, a balance between persistence and seeking help is essential for improving your coding and programming skills. Don't be afraid to tackle difficult problems, but also know when to take a step back and seek guidance.

# labels, postfix/prefix

# labels

Sometimes we have nested loops

```js
for (let i=0;i<3;i++) {
    for (let j=0;j<3;j++) {
        let userInput = prompt('How are you?','');
        if (!userInput) {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

When `userInput` is `null` or `undefined`, or an empty string value, it break the loop,

but in this case it break only the inner loop.

When we want to completely break both loops,

we use <strong>labels</strong>.

A label is an identifier that comes before for loop.

```js
outer: for (let i=0;i<3;i++) {
    inner: for (let j=0;j<3;j++) {
        let userInput = prompt('How are you?','');
        if (!userInput) {
            break inner;
        }
    }
}
```

I put `outer` and `inner` and colon `:` in front of the `for` keyword.

`outer` and `inner` are identifiers.

And then after `after` keyword, write the name of the label. 

In this case, either `inner`.

(outer is not used in this example, it was just to demonstrate how to add label)


# postfix/prefix

postfix example 

```js
let i=0;
i++;
```

prefix example

```js
let i=0;
++i;
```

postfix example returns the original value first, and then does the calculations (either `--` or `++`).

prefix example returns the calculated value.

# Example

```js
let i =2;

i = ++i + i++ * i
```

(source : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42773637/javascript-postfix-and-prefix-increment-in-expression)

The answer is `15`. 

Because 

`++i` is 3.

`i++` returns original value `3` but now `i` is 4.

`i++ * i` is `3 * 4`

`++i + i++ * i` is `3 + 12` so the answer is `15`.


# Example 2

Guess the outputs in the console.

```js
let i=0;
while (++i < 5) {
    console.log(i);
}

console.log('-----')

i=0;
while (i++ < 5) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

What are outputs in the console?

```

2
3

# `(++i < 5)` works like this.

`++i` returns the calculated value.

Initially `i` was 0, but it compares `(1 < 5)`, because `++i` is 1, is true, so prints `1`

`i` is `1`, it compares `(2 < 5)`, is true, so prints `2`

`i` is `2`, it compares `(3 < 5)`, is true, so prints `3`

`i` is `3`, it compares `(4 < 5)`, is true, so prints `4`

`i` is `4`, it compares `(5 < 5)`, is false, so does NOT print. 

output:

```
1
2
3
4
```

# `(i++ < 5)` works like this.

`i++` returns the original `i` value, and does the calculation `++` afterwards.

Initially `i` was 0, and it compares `(0 < 5)`, because `i++` returns original value 0, and it adds 1 later, is true, so prints `1`.

`i` is 1, it compares `(1 < 5)`, is true, adds 1, so prints `2`

`i` is 2, it compares `(2 < 5)`, is true, adds 1, so prints `3`

`i` is 3, it compares `(3 < 5)`, is true, adds 1, so prints `4`

`i` is 4, it compares `(4 < 5)`, is true, adds 1, so prints `5`

`i` is 5, it compares `(5 < 5)`, is false, so does NOT print.

output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

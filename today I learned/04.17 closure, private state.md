# What is a closure?

Closure is when an inner function uses/changes variables that are in the outside of the function.

Let's look at a simple example

```js
function outer() {

    let outerVariable = 'apple';

    function inner() {
        
        return outerVariable;
    }

    return inner();
}

console.log(outer());   //'apple'
```

The function `inner` used the `outerVariable` that is outside of `inner` function scope, and it is a case for a closure.

We call that `inner function closes over outerVariable`.

We can take another example where inner function changes the value of a outer variable.

```js
function outer() {

    let outerVariable = 15;

    function inner() {

        return outerVariable + 5;
    }

    return inner();
}

console.log(outer());       // 20
```

In the above example, we called the `outer` and `outer` function returned the value of `inner()`.

So from this moment, outer function has stopped its execution, and now `inner` function performs and still access to `outerVariable` outside of `inner` function. 

It not only accesses but also changes the value of the `outerVariable`.

Let's take an example

```js
function wrapperFunction() {
    let collection = [];

    function privateFunction(item) {
        collection.push(item);

        return collection;
    }

    return privateFunction;
}

let addItemToVault = wrapperFunction();
console.log(addItemToVault('watch'));      //[ 'watch' ]
console.log(addItemToVault('gold bar'));  //[ 'watch', 'gold bar' ]

let addItemToMyPocket = wrapperFunction();
console.log(addItemToMyPocket('small stone')); // [ 'small stone' ]
```

we can see that 'watch' and 'gold bar' are added to a collection, and

'small stone' is added to another collection.

'collection' can be modified only by the 'privateFunction'.

# Private state

We actually just looked at the example of private state.

Let's take a look at an example of 'not a private state'

```js
let counter = 0;

function incrementCounter(){
    counter++;
    console.log(counter);
}

incrementCounter();     // 1
incrementCounter();     // 2
incrementCounter();     // 3
```

We see that the variable counter is declared in the global scope.

This counter variable is accessed by any other function if we were to create another function, like 'resetCounter'.

```js
let counter = 0;

function incrementCounter(){
    counter++;
    console.log(counter);
}

incrementCounter();     // 1
incrementCounter();     // 2
incrementCounter();     // 3

function resetCounter() {
    counter = 0;
    console.log('hahaha counter is ' + counter);
}

resetCounter();         // hahaha counter is 0
```

In the above example, we saw that resetCounter changed counter's value to 0.

##### Private state prevents from happening this by declaring a variable inside the function. Because it is a local scope.

```js
function safeplace() {
    let counter = 0;

    function increment() {
        counter++;
        return counter;
    }

    function decrement() {
        counter--;
        return counter;
    }

    function viewCounter() {
        return counter;
    }

    return { 
        increment,
        decrement,
        viewCounter
     };
}

let mySafePlaceForCounter = safeplace();
console.log(mySafePlaceForCounter.viewCounter());    // 0
console.log(mySafePlaceForCounter.increment());      // 1
console.log(mySafePlaceForCounter.increment());      // 2
console.log(mySafePlaceForCounter.decrement());      // 1
console.log(mySafePlaceForCounter.viewCounter());    // 1

function changeCounter() {
    console.log('let me try to change the counter to 0!')
    counter = 0;
    return counter;
}

console.log(changeCounter());     // 0

console.log(mySafePlaceForCounter.viewCounter());    // 1
```

We can see that the counter in mySafePlaceForCounter still remains 1, even though changeCounter() tried to change the counter to 0.

What 'changeCounter()' did was to declare a global variable called counter. (it used without let, const, or var)

Like the example above, the counter can only be accessible by safeplace().

By doing this, we can have less unintended behaviors in our code.

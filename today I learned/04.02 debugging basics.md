# Debugging basics

Let's take a look at the following code.

```js
greatProgrammer.writePerfectCodes = false;

greatProgrammer.isGoodDebugger = true;
```

A great programmer doesn't mean they write perfect codes, but they are good debuggers.

In fact, they created tens of thousands of bugs, and fixed them.

A simple three debugging techniques:

    - [Read the error message](#read-the-error-message)

    - [Use `console.log()` to find a buggy code](#use-consolelog-to-find-a-malfunctioning-code)

    - [Write tests that cover common use and edge cases](#write-tests-that-cover-common-use-and-special-cases)


## Read the error message

Let's look at the example



## Use `console.log()` to find a malfunctioning code

Let's take a look at the example below.

What's wrong witht this code?

```js
function removeOranges(arr){
    for (let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
        if (arr[i]=='orange'){
            arr.splice(i,1);
        }
    }
    return arr;
}

console.log(removeOranges(['orange','orange','orange','peach'])) // [ 'orange', 'peach' ]
```

It doesn't remove all the 'orange's in the array. What we can do is to write `console.log()` to see where we went wrong.

```js
function removeOranges(arr){
    for (let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
        console.log(`current iteration : ${i}, current array : ${arr}`)
        if (arr[i]=='orange'){
            arr.splice(i,1);
        }
    }
    return arr;
}

console.log(removeOranges(['orange','orange','orange','peach']))
```

The result:

```
current iteration : 0, current array : orange,orange,orange,peach
current iteration : 1, current array : orange,orange,peach
[ 'orange', 'peach' ]
```

Thanks to `console.log()` we can see that this has gone through only 2 iterations, so we can tell there was something wrong with for loop, which is that it didnt iterate `arr.length` number of times that is 4.

We can guess that when the current iteration is 0, the current array is orange,orange,orange,peach, `arr.splice(0,1)` changed arr to `['orange','orange','peach']`. 

But in the next iteration i has changed to 1 from 0, since final expression of the for loop is `i++`, and the current array is `['orange','orange','peach']`. So we can guess that it `arr.splice(1,1)` removed the second element of the current array, therefore `['orange','peach']` is left. And i has changed from 1 to 2 at the end of this iteration.

The in the next iteration, i is 2, but the condition is `i<arr.length` where `arr.length` is two already. So it stops the iteration and returns the final arr which is `['orange', 'peach']`.

And how can we solve this problem? The problem takes place when array's length got shortened, but i has increased. 

<em>What actually happened</em>

```
- First iteration

i is initialized to 0
condition: i < 4
current i: 0

Before
Array: ['orange','orange','orange','peach'], current i: 0 

splice(0,0) occurs

After
Array: ['orange','orange','peach'], current i: 1

- Second iteration

condition: i < 3
current i: 1

Before
Array: ['orange','orange','peach'], current i: 1

splice(1,0) occurs (it removes the second 'orange' whose index position is 1)

After
Array: ['orange','peach'], current i: 2

- Third iteration

condition: i < 2
current i: 2

Condition is not true, so it breaks out of the for loop

Returns a current array: ['orange','peach']
```

To fix this problem, we can use following codes.

```js
function removeOranges(arr){
    let b = [];
    for (let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
        console.log(b,a[i])
        if (a[i]!=='orange'){
            b.push(a[i])
        }
    }
    return b;
}

console.log(removeOranges(['orange','orange','orange','peach'])) // ['peach']
```

```js
function removeOranges(arr){
    for (let i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
        if (arr[i]==="orange"){
            arr.splice(i,1)
            i--;
        }
    }
    return arr;
}

console.log(removeOranges(['orange','orange','orange','peach'])) // ['peach']
```

## Write tests that cover common use and special cases

Let's take a look at the code below.

We wanted to create a function that counts down from the num to 1.

It seems to work fine, but there is one serious problem in the code. 

```js
function countdown(num) {
    while (num !== 0) {
        console.log(num);
        num--;
    }
}

countdown(5);
```

The answer is that when num is negative number it goes infinite loop.

So we need to change the code to 

```js
function countdown(num) {
    while (num > 0) {
        console.log(num);
        num--;
    }
}

countdown(5);
```

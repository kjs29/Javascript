# Functions as data

In JS, we can use functions as variables.

Let's say we have function named `checkTwoPlustTwoEqualsMillionTimes`.

```js
const checkTwoPlustTwoEqualsMillionTimes = () => {
    for (let i=0;i<1000000;i++){
        console.log(`2 + 2 = ${2+2}`)
    }
}
```

we can store this function in a variable called `tstm`.

```js
const tstm = checkTwoPlusTwoEqualsMillionTimes
```

We can call this function like this below.

```js
tstm()
```

If we forgot what this `tstm` represents, we can use `name` property.

```js
console.log(tstm.name) // checkTwoPlusTwoEqualsMillionTimes
```

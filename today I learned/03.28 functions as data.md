# Functions as data

In JS, we can use functions as variables.

Let's say we have function named `checkTwoPlustTwoEqualsMillionTimes`.

```js
const checkTwoPlustTwoEqualsMillionTimes = () => {
    for (let i=0;i<1000000;i++){
        console.log(`2 + 2 = ${2+2}`)
    }
}
```

we can store this function in a variable called `tstm`.

```js
const tstm = checkTwoPlusTwoEqualsMillionTimes
```

We can call this function like this below.

```js
tstm()
```

If we forgot what this `tstm` represents, we can use `name` property.

```js
console.log(tstm.name) // checkTwoPlusTwoEqualsMillionTimes
```

# Mutually Exclusive conditions

We can see codes like this below

```js
function numberTest(number) {
    if (numberTest < 100) {
        console.log("Small");
    }
    if (numberTest = 100) {
        console.log("Small");
    }
    if (number > 100) {
        console.log("Big");
    }
}
```

But this code repeats itself and we should follow the rule of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself!).

```js
function numberTest(number) {
    if (numberTest <= 100) {
        console.log("Small");
    }
    else {
        console.log("Big");
    }
}
```

We can think of mutually exclusivity as flip a coin. 

It can be either head or tail but not both.

# ternary operator

We can see that `if ~ else ~` like code below.

```js
const korean = true;
if (korean) {
    console.log("You should serve in the military");
} else {
    console.log("You don't have to serve in the military");
}
```

We can use ternary operator to do the same thing.

```js
const korean = true;
(korean) ? console.log("You should serve in the military") : console.log("You don't have to serve in the military");
```

The syntax is `(condition) ? codes to be executed when it is true + codes to be executed when it is false`

# logical operator + short hand

```js
const falseValue = false;
const trueValue = true;

let random = falseValue || trueValue ;
```

the `||` always assign truthy value to variable. And the value of the `random` is determined from left to right.

So JavaScript determines whether `falseValue` is true or not, and then if it is `true`, it is `true`, but if it is `false`, it moves on to `trueValue`, and see if it's `true` or `false`.

# Hoisting

Hoisting means that when we run our files, some variables are brought to the top of the file.

Let's take a look at an example.

```js
console.log(random());

function random() {
    return 'random';
}
```
This will output

```
random
```

`function` keyword is hoisted to the top of the file, so 

even though it was defined later, it still printed out the return value of the `random()` function.

Let's take another example.

```js
let a = 'a';
console.log(a);     // 'a'
```

But this won't work.

```js
console.log(a);     // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization
let a = 'a';
```

Like we saw this example above, keyword `let` and `const` are not hoisted.

Therefore the following example wont also work for hoisting.

```js
console.log(a);         // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization

const a = function() {
    return 'a';
}
```

However the keyword `var` is hoisted but it is hoisted with undefined value.

```js
console.log(a);     // undefined

var a = 'a';
```

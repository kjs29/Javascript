# Clone objects

There are 7 different primitive data types and 1 object type.

Primitive data types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`. 

Object data type: `object`, `array`, `date`

When we assign an object to a variable, that variable now has the reference to the object.

We can check whether two variables references point to the same object or different objects, using `===`.

Let's consider this example.

```js
let person = {      // an object is assigned to a variable 'person'
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
}

// clone the person to person1
let person1 = person;

// compare if they share the same memory address
console.log(person === person1);
```

The output:

```
true
```

'`person === person1` is true' means that when changing object from one side affects the other variable.

Let's see if that is true.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
}

let person1 = person;

// change person1's age property
person1.age = 99;

console.log(person1);           // { age: 99, name: 'John' }
```

## We can see that changing `person1`'s age affected `person`'s age.

This rule applies to arrays (Another object type) as well.

```js
let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];

let numbers1 = numbers;

numbers[0] = 0;

console.log(numbers1);      //[0,2,3,4,5], changing 'numbers' affected numbers1
```

To clone an object, and not be affected by the changes from the other side.

There are a couple different ways to clone an object.

1.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
}

let clone = Object.assign({}, person);

console.log(person === clone);     //false
```

2.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
}

let clone = {};

for (let eachProp in person) {
    clone[eachProp] = person[eachProp];
}

console.log(person === clone);     //false
```

Now we can see that `person` and `clone` are not the same because `person === clone` is `false`.

We call this shallow copying.

# What if person1 or clone had nested object as their property?

Let's consider this example.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
    dog: {
        name: 'Daisy',
        age: 4
    }
}
```

Now `person` object has `dog` property that is an object(`{name: 'Daisy', age:4}`) as well.

Let's copy the `person` like we did before.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
    dog: {
        name: 'Daisy',
        age: 4
    }
}

// clone person object to clone1
let clone1 = Object.assign({}, person);

// clone person object to clone2
let clone2 = {};
for (let eachProp in person) {
    clone2[eachProp] = person[eachProp];
} 

console.log(clone1);        // { age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 4 } }
console.log(clone2);        // { age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 4 } }

console.log(person === clone1);     //false
console.log(person === clone2);     //false
console.log(clone1 === clone2);     //false
```

We copied the person object to clone1, and clone2.

We checked that person, clone1, and clone2 all indicates to different memory address using (`===`).

```js
console.log(person === clone1);     //false
console.log(person === clone2);     //false
console.log(clone1 === clone2);     //false
```

It seems like everything seems good now.

Until we changed the value of `person`'s `dog` property.

```js
person.dog.age = 5;
```

The expected outcome for clone1, and clone2 should be the same.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
    dog: {
        name: 'Daisy',
        age: 4
    }
}

let clone1 = Object.assign({}, person);
let clone2 = {};
for (let eachProp in person) {
    clone2[eachProp] = person[eachProp];
} 

// change person's dog's age.
person.dog.age = 5;

console.log(person);     // { age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 5 } }
console.log(clone1);     // { age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 5 } }
console.log(clone2);     // { age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 5 } }
```

We changed `person`'s dog's age from 4 to 5.

Notice that `clone1` and `clone2`'s dog property changed too.

It happened because we used the shallow copying.

When we copied our object `person` to `clone1`, and `clone2`, 

all the properties from `person` are copied, using the references.

### When copying or assigning, primitive data types(number, string, boolean, null, undefined) are passed by values,

### but objects(arrays, objects, functions) are passed by references.

To prevent this from happening, 

we can deep copy.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
    dog: {
        name: 'Daisy',
        age: 4,
        
    }
};

let clone1 = structuredClone(person);

clone1.dog.age = 5;

console.log(clone1);    //{ age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 5 } }
console.log(person);    //{ age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 4 } }
```

We can see that changing `clone1.dog.age` does NOT change `person.dog.age`.

We use `structuredClone()` to copy an object deeply.

Now the nested objects can be created without using the same references.

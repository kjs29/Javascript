# Clone objects

There are 7 different primitive data types and 1 object type.

Primitive data types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`. 

Object data type: `object`, `array`, `date`

<em>Examples of different data types</em>

```js
// primitive data types
let a = 'hello world';
let b = 1234;
let c = true;
let d = null;
let e = undefined;

// object data types
let f = [1,2,3,4];
let g = {
    AAPL: 'Apple',
    GOOG: 'Google',
    MSFT: 'Microsoft'
}
```

The difference between primitive data types and object data types is the following.

## When we assign primitive data types to a variable, the variable now has the value,

## When we assign an object to a variable, that variable now has the reference to the object.

Let's think about what the sentence above means.

In the example above, 

`a` is assigned with a string `'hello world'`, which is a primitive data type.

When the string 'hello world' is assigned to a variable `a`, `a` now has the string 'hello world'.

`f` is assigned with an array `[1,2,3,4]`, which is an object data type.

When the array `[1,2,3,4]` is assigned to a variable `f`, `f` now has the <strong>reference</strong> to the array `[1,2,3,4]`, instead of `[1,2,3,4]` itself.

Can another variable have the reference as `f`'s? 

The answer is `YES`.

We can check whether two variables' references point to the same object or different objects, using `===`.

Let's consider this example.

```js
let person = {      // an object is assigned to a variable 'person'
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
}

// clone the person to person1
let person1 = person;

// compare if they share the same memory address
console.log(person === person1);
```

The output:

```
true
```

'`person === person1` is true' means that they have the reference to the same object,

We say the object is aliased.

When the object is aliased, changing object from one side affects the other variable.

Let's find out if that is true.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
}

let person1 = person;

// change ONLY person1's age property
person1.age = 99;

console.log(person);           // { age: 99, name: 'John' }
```

## We can see that changing `person1`'s age affected `person`'s age.

By the way, this rule does NOT apply to primitve data types.

```js
let person = 'John';

let person1 = person;

person = 'Chris';       // *

console.log(person1);       // 'John'
```

Because when 'John' was assigned to a variable `person`, `person` has the string value, not the reference to the string value.

When `person` is assigned to a variable `person1`, now `person1` has the value of 'John', not the reference.

When `person`'s value is changed to 'Chris', it simply changes the value, and `person1` still has the value 'John'.

Once again, each variables `person` and `person1` have the value of `John` and `Chris` respectively, not the reference to the value.

## When we assign primitive data types to a variable, the variable now has the value,

## When we assign an object to a variable, that variable now has the reference to the object.

Let's see if this applies to arrays, which is another object type.

```js
let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];  //array that contains different numbers

let numbers1 = numbers; //numbers1 now has the reference to [1,2,3,4,5] too

// change ONLY 'numbers' first element to 0
numbers[0] = 0;

console.log(numbers1);      //[0,2,3,4,5], changing 'numbers' affected 'numbers1'
```

We can see that changing one variable(numbers) affects the other variable(numbers1).

## To clone an object and not be affected by the changes from the other side,

## there are a couple different ways to clone an object.

1.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
}

let clone = Object.assign({}, person);

console.log(person === clone);     //false
```

2.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
}

let clone = {};

for (let eachProp in person) {
    clone[eachProp] = person[eachProp];
}

console.log(person === clone);     //false
```

Now we can see that `person` and `clone` are not the same because `person === clone` is `false`.

We call this shallow copying.

# What if person1 or clone had nested object as their property?

Let's consider this example.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
    dog: {
        name: 'Daisy',
        age: 4
    }
}
```

Now `person` object has `dog` property that is an object(`{name: 'Daisy', age:4}`) as well.

Let's copy the `person` like we did before.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
    dog: {
        name: 'Daisy',
        age: 4
    }
}

// clone person object to clone1
let clone1 = Object.assign({}, person);

// clone person object to clone2
let clone2 = {};
for (let eachProp in person) {
    clone2[eachProp] = person[eachProp];
} 

console.log(clone1);        // { age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 4 } }
console.log(clone2);        // { age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 4 } }

console.log(person === clone1);     //false
console.log(person === clone2);     //false
console.log(clone1 === clone2);     //false
```

We copied the person object to clone1, and clone2.

We checked that person, clone1, and clone2 all indicates to different memory address using (`===`).

```js
console.log(person === clone1);     //false
console.log(person === clone2);     //false
console.log(clone1 === clone2);     //false
```

It seems like everything seems good now.

Until we changed the value of `person`'s `dog` property.

```js
person.dog.age = 5;
```

The expected outcome for clone1, and clone2 should be the same.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
    dog: {
        name: 'Daisy',
        age: 4
    }
}

let clone1 = Object.assign({}, person);
let clone2 = {};
for (let eachProp in person) {
    clone2[eachProp] = person[eachProp];
} 

// change person's dog's age.
person.dog.age = 5;

console.log(person);     // { age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 5 } }
console.log(clone1);     // { age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 5 } }
console.log(clone2);     // { age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 5 } }
```

What!

We changed `person`'s dog's age from 4 to 5.

Notice that `clone1` and `clone2`'s dog property changed too.

It happened because we used the shallow copying.

When we copied our object `person` to `clone1`, and `clone2`, 

all the properties from `person` are copied, using the references.

### When copying or assigning, primitive data types(number, string, boolean, null, undefined) are passed by values,

### but objects(arrays, objects, functions) are passed by references.

To prevent this from happening, 

we can deep copy.

```js
let person = {
    age: 30,
    name: "John",
    dog: {
        name: 'Daisy',
        age: 4,
        
    }
};

// deep copying person object to clone1
let clone1 = structuredClone(person);

clone1.dog.age = 5;

console.log(clone1);    //{ age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 5 } }
console.log(person);    //{ age: 30, name: 'John', dog: { name: 'Daisy', age: 4 } }
```

We can see that changing `clone1.dog.age` does NOT change `person.dog.age`.

We use `structuredClone()` to copy an object deeply.

With the help of deep copying, the nested objects can be created without using the same references.

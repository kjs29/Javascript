```
npm install chai-spies
```

```js
const spies = require('chai-spies');
chai.use(spies)
```

what is a spy?

Spy is something that we want to check.

Let's say we want to check if `Person`'s method `sayHello()` has been called.

Then `Person` class' `sayHello()` method becomes a spy.

Create spy

```js
chai.spy.on(object, '<methodName>');
```

or we can assign this to a variable.

```js
const spyMethod = chai.spy.on(object, '<methodName>');
```

For example,

let's say we have a class named `Person` with a method `sayHello()`.

```js
class Person {
    constructor(name){
        this.name = name;
    }

    sayHello() {
        console.log('hello');
    }
}
```


### To check if a method has been called once

```js
describe('Person class', ()=>{
    it('sayHello() should have been called once', () => {

        // create an instance first
        const newPerson = new Person("Jin");

        // create a spy on newPerson's method sayHello
        // and assign it to a variable
        const testMethod = chai.spy.on(newPerson, 'sayHello');

        // call sayHello on an instance
        newPerson.sayHello();

        // assert that spy has been called once
        expect(testMethod).to.have.been.called.once;
    });
});
```


`chai.spy.on(newPerson, 'sayHello');` allows us to track whether newPerson's method `sayHello` was called, or how many times it has been called, or with what argument.

Alternatively we can write test spec like the example below.

```js
describe('Person class', ()=>{
    it('sayHello() should have been called once', () => {

        // create an instance first
        const newPerson = new Person("Jin");

        // create a spy on newPerson's method sayHello
        // and assign it to a variable
        chai.spy.on(newPerson, 'sayHello');

        // call sayHello on an instance
        newPerson.sayHello();

        // assert that spy has been called once
        expect(newPerson.sayHello).to.have.been.called.once;
    });
});
```

Let's assume that `Person` class has an instance method that invokes `sayHello()` method and returns `My name is ${this.name}`.

```js
class Person {
    constructor(name){
        this.name = name;
    }

    sayHello() {
        console.log('hello');
    }

    introduce() {
        this.sayHello();
        return `My name is ${this.name}`
    }
}
```

To test if `introduce()` calls `sayHello()`,

```js
const chai = require('chai');
const expect = chai.expect;
const spies = require('chai-spies');

chai.use(spies);

describe("introduce()", ()=>{
    it("should call 'sayHello()'", ()=>{
        let newPerson = new Person('Jin');
        chai.spy.on(newPerson, 'sayHello');

        newPerson.introduce();

        expect(newPerson.sayHello).to.have.been.called.exactly(1);
    });
});
```

In this case, the spy is created to track if the sayHello method is called on the newPerson object. 

After creating the spy, you can use `expect(newPerson.sayHello).to.have.been.called.exactly(1);` to assert that the `sayHello` method has been called exactly once.

# Equivalent vs identical

Yesterday, I covered equivalent and identical objects [here](https://github.com/kjs29/Python/blob/master/Today%20I%20learned/2023/05.11%20equivalent%2C%20identical%2C%20aliased%20object.md)


Let's take a look at this example

```js
let first = [1,2,3];
let second = first.reverse();

console.log(first);     //[3,2,1]
console.log(second);    //[3,2,1]
```

We can see that both of them are `[3,2,1]`

The reason why they are both `[3,2,1]` is that `second` variable refers to the `first` object.

When `second` changed, the first also changes.

`luckyNumber` checks if the value:number is a palindrome number.

```js
function luckyNumber(value) {
  let array = String(value).split('');
  let reversed = array.reverse();
  
  console.log(array);
  console.log(reversed);

  return array === reversed;
}
```

But this is a wrong example, because they will always be the same.

The correct example would be `to create a string instead of array`.

```js
function luckyNumber(value) {
  let array = String(value);
  let reversed = array.split('').reverse().join('');
  
  console.log(array);
  console.log(reversed);

  return array === reversed;
}
```

Strings are immutable and only mutable aliased object share the same addresses, so changes made to one variable affect the other.

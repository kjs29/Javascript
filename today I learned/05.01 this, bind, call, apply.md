# This, Call, Apply

In JavaScript, 

`this` keyword is used quite often.

```js
class Car {
    constructor (model, year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    startEngine () {
        return `Start engine - ${this.model} from ${this.year}`;
    }
}

const firstCar = new Car('G-Class', 2023);
console.log(firstCar.startEngine());       // Start engine - G-Class from 2023
```

In the above example, `this` refers to an object that the method was called upon.

```
'this' is the same as firstCar
```

We can check it by

```js
class Car {
    test(){
        return this == car;
    }
}

const car = new Car();
console.log(car.test());        //true
```

We can also call `this` in a function

```js
function hello() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
}

hello();      // undefined
```

But we only just get undefined value for this.

In order to combine some other object to another object's properties, we can use bind to connect.

```js
function hello() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
}

const alice = {
    name: 'Alice'
};

const helloOnAlice = hello.bind(alice);

console.log(helloOnAlice);      // [Function: bound hello]
console.log(helloOnAlice());    // Hello, Alice
```


`bind` function doesn't invoke a function but creates a new function and that has the same function body as the original one(in this case, `hello()`) but with the `this` value bound to specified object `alice`.

In short,

```js
const helloOnAlice = hello.bind(alice);
```

is the same as 

```js
const helloOnAlice = () => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${alice.name}`);
}
```

Therefore, in order to call a new function object `helloOnAlice`, we need to add parenthesis ().

`call` and `apply` are similar. They act the same way as bind method does. 

call and apply both don't need parenthesis to call the function, only difference between call and apply is apply takes only two arguments, the first one is an object they want to assign their value in replacement of `this`, and second argument is an array of the function's arguments.

For example,

<em>call</em>

```js
function introduce(age, homeCountry) {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}, I am ${age} years old from ${homeCountry}`);
}

const alice = {
    name: 'Alice'
};

introduce.call(alice, 66, 'Korea');      // Hello, my name is Alice, I am 66 years old from Korea
```

<em>apply</em>

```js
function introduce(age, homeCountry) {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}, I am ${age} years old from ${homeCountry}`);
}

const alice = {
    name: 'Alice'
};

introduce.apply(alice,[ 66, 'Korea']);      // Hello, my name is Alice, I am 66 years old from Korea
```


Let's look at this example.

```js
class User {
    constructor(name, rank) {
        this.name = name;
        this.rank = rank;
    }

    introduce() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is my name, ${this.rank} is my rank`);
    }
}

const user1 = new User('Jinsung','diamond');
const user1Intro = user1.introduce;

console.log(user1Intro);        // [Function: introduce]
```

In the example above, the last line prints `[Function: introduce]` because I am not calling the method.

I am just console.logging the reference to the method itself.

That is why it just shows `[Function: introduce]`.

When I modified the last line to 

```
user1Intro();
```

it shows

```
console.log(`${this.name} is my name, ${this.rank} is my rank`);
                            ^

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
```

In order to print 

```
Jinsung is my name, diamond is my rank
```

We need to correctly bind `this` to the correct context which is `user1`.

We can change 

```js
const user1Intro = user1.introduce;
```

to

1.

```js
const user1Intro = user1.introduce.bind(user1);

user1Intro();       // 'Jinsung is my name, diamond is my rank'
```

2.

```js
user1.introduce.call(user1);        // 'Jinsung is my name, diamond is my rank'
```

3.

```js
user1.introduce.apply(user1);        // 'Jinsung is my name, diamond is my rank'
```

But these 1,2,3 are not good cases for bind, call, and apply because we can easily call introduce from user1 object like `user1.introduce()`.

Good case for bind, call, and apply would be when we borrow methods from one class for use with another class.

```js
class User {
    constructor(name, rank) {
        this.name = name;
        this.rank = rank;
    }

    introduce() {
        console.log(`I am an user ${this.name}.`);
    }
}

class Manager {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    greet() {
        console.log(`I am a manager ${this.name}.`)
    }
}

const user1 = new User('Jinsung','diamond');
const user2 = new Manager('Alice');

user2.greet.call(user1);        // I am a manager Jinsung.
```

The above example demonstrates borrowing the introduce method from the Manager class to use it with the user1 object, and then calling it.

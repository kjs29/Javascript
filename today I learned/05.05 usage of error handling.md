# We will learn how to use error handling in JavaScript

Let's look at this code below.

```js
console.log(10 / 0);
```

The console logs

```
Infinity
```

But what if we want to throw our own customized error that says 'Numbers can't be divided by 0'?

In this case we use can use `throw`.

Since testing if `console.log(10 / 0)` really prints `Infinity` requires some testing tool, 

let's assume that we have the following code to test to throw our customized error.

```js
let result = 10 / 0;
```

Then we can throw an error if result is `Infinity`.

```js
let result = 10 / 0 ;

if (result === Infinity) {
    throw new Error("Can't be divided by 0.");
}
```

or we can write like this alternatively.

```js
if (10 / 0 === Infinity) {
    throw new Error("CAn't be divided by 0.");
}
```


Then it will show

```
throw new Error("Can't be divided by 0.");
    ^

Error: Can't be divided by 0.

Once we throw our customized error, this also stops the whole program execution.

In other words, once the error is thrown, anything below the line won't be executed.

To fix this issue, we can use `try...catch` block.

```js
try {
    let result = 10 / 0;
    if (result === Infinity) {
        throw new Error("Can't be divided by 0.");      // customized error
    } else {
        console.log(result);
    }
} catch(error) {
    console.log(error.message);     // the customized error is caught here.
                                    // prints "Can't be divided by 0."
}
```

The example above demonstrates that 

1. we throw our own customized error, 

2. and handled the error with `try...catch` block.

(`catch(){}` is supposed to catch any error that `try{}` creates, in this case, it caught our customized error with message `Can't be divided by 0.`)

### Key things to keep in mind is that

1. We should be in control of what errors it will occur and should be able to throw our own error.

This can be done by `throw new Error(<message>)`

2. In order to not crash, we can use `try...catch` block to handle errors gracefully.

[Writing a test file](#we-can-write-a-test-file-like-this)

Testing is necessary in developing softwares.

There are unit test, integration test, and End-to-end test.

Unit Test is the most basic test, and it tests smallest unit like function, class' properties, or methods.

Let's go over unit test here.

We can use a testing framework called `mocha`.

## Procedures

1. Create a directory `testing-folder` and go to the directory.

    ```
    mkdir testing-folder && cd testing-folder
    ```

2. Create `package.json` file for dependencies.

    ```
    npm init
    ```

    Then it will show

    ```
    This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
    It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

    See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
    and exactly what they do.

    Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
    save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

    Press ^C at any time to quit.
    package name: (testing-folder) 
    ```

    It will ask for package name, version, etc.

    Just press enter, until it asks for 'test command'.

    We type `mocha` when it asks for 'test command'.

    And it will create a `package.json` at the end.

    <em>package.json</em>

    ```json
    {
      "name": "testing-folder",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "",
      "main": "index.js",
      "scripts": {
        "test": "mocha"
      },
      "author": "",
      "license": "ISC"
    }
    ```


3. Download `mocha` and `chai`.

    We can download `mocha` and `chai` as a development dependency on our project.

    ```
    npm install mocha chai --save-dev
    ```

    `Mocha` is a JavaScript testing framework and `chai` is an assertion library.


4. Create javascript file to test, and test file.

    And now it is time to create a javascript file to test.

    We can name it `person.js`.

    <em>person.js</em>

    ```js
    class Person {
        constructor(name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
    }

    module.exports = { Person };
    ```

    Notice that we have to export the class `Person` 

    In a test file, we will have to import it. 

    #### Usually test file goes in `test` directory, and the filename is `<javascriptfilename>-spec.js`.

    ```
    test-folder
    │
    ├── test/
    │   └ person-spec.js
    │
    └── person.js
    ```

    In the `test/person-spec.js`, 

    We can write this.

    <em>person-spec.js</em>

    ```js
    const chai = require('chai');               // import chai library
    const expect = chai.expect;                 // we need to use 'expect' from chai library

    const { Person } = require('../person');    // import Person class from 'person.js' file
    ```

    So, as an example, if we want to check if an instance of `Person` class has `name` property,

    #### we can write a test file like this.

    ```js
    const chai = require('chai');
    const expect = chai.expect;

    const { Person } = require('../person');

    describe('Person class', function() {
      
      it('should have name property', function() {
        
        const testPerson = new Person('testName');
        
        expect(testPerson).to.have.property('name');

      });

    });
    ```

    `describe()` function is used to create a suite of test cases or to group test cases.

    describe accepts two arguments, the first one being the string that describes the group of test case suite, 

    the second one being the function that has test cases or another nested `describe` function.

    (Sometimes as our codes get more complicated, we need to organize our test cases better.
      
    It is up to us to have nested `describe()`,

    if we need more structure to our test cases,
    
    we can create another nested `describe()` inside `describe()`.)

    `describe()`'s basic structure looks like this.

    ```js
    describe('Person class', function() {
      
      // test cases go here
      it('',function(){})

    })
    ```

    `it()` function actually tests cases. It also takes two arguments like `describe()`,

    the first one would be a description, and the second one is a function that tests the case.

    ```js
    it('should have property', function() {
      
      const testPerson = new Person('testname');

      expect(testPerson).to.have.property('name');

    });
    ```

    `it()` goes inside the `describe()` function.


    ### 4. Test the case.

    We can test our code by typing

    ```
    npm test
    ```

    And it will show

    either red, green color in the test.

    ```
    > testing-folder@1.0.0 test
    > mocha



      Person class
        ✔ should have name property


      1 passing (6ms)
    ```

    In the test above, we can see `Person class` and `should have name property`.

    They represent the first arugment in `describe()` and `it()`, respectively.
    
    After the test passing, we can also refactor our code further.

    When test fails, it can look like this below.

    ```js
    > mocha-test2@1.0.0 test
    > mocha



      Person class
        1) should have name property


      0 passing (8ms)
      1 failing

      1) Person class
          should have name property:
        AssertionError: expected Person{ age: 'testName' } to have property 'name'
          at Context.<anonymous> (test/person-spec.js:12:36)
          at process.processImmediate (node:internal/timers:471:21)

    ```

    In this case, we can see `expected Person{ age: 'testName' } to have property 'name'` as error message.

    Then we can change property name from `age` to `name` in `Person` class in the `person.js` file.

    It is important to test what we want to test accurately.

[Writing a test file](#we-can-write-a-test-file-like-this)

Testing is necessary in developing softwares.

There are unit test, integration test, and End-to-end test.

Unit Test is the most basic test, and it tests smallest unit like function, class' properties, or methods.

Let's go over unit test here.

We can use a testing framework called `mocha`.

### 1. Download `mocha`

In order to use `mocha` we should download `mocha`, by typing

```
npm install --global mocha
```

This will download mocha globally and we will be able to use it.

Or as a development dependency on our project

```
npm install --save-dev mocha
```

Procedures

1. Create a directory `testing-folder` and go to the directory.

2. type 

```
npm init
```


Then it will show

```
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (testing-folder) 
```

It will ask for package name, version, etc.

We type `mocha` when it asks for 'test command'.

And it will create a `package.json` at the end.

<em>package.json</em>

```json

{
  "name": "testing-folder",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

### 2. Download `chai`

Also, we will download `chai`, `chai` is an assertion library.

In the root directory where `package.json` file is located at, 

type 

```
npm install chai
```

And it starts downloading `chai`.


### 3. Create javascript file to test, and test file.

And now it is time to create a javascript file to test.

We can name it `person.js`.

<em>person.js</em>

```js
class Person {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

module.exports = { Person };
```

Notice that we have to export the class `Person` 

because in test file, we will have to import it.

#### Usually test file goes in `test` directory, and the filename is `<javascriptfilename>-spec.js`.

```
test-folder
│
├── test/
│   └ person-spec.js
│
└── person.js
```

In the `test/person-spec.js`, 

We can write this.

<em>person-spec.js</em>

```js
const chai = require('chai');               // import chai library
const expect = chai.expect;                 // we need to use 'expect' from chai library

const { Person } = require('../person');    // import Person class from 'person.js' file
```

So, as an example, if we want to check if the `Person` class has `name` property,

#### we can write a test file like this.

```js
const chai = require('chai');
const expect = chai.expect;

const { Person } = require('../person');

describe('Person class', function() {
  it('should have name property', function() {
    const testPerson = new Person('testName');
    expect(testPerson).to.have.property('name');
  });
});
```

`describe()` function is used to create a suite of test cases or to group test cases.

describe accepts two arguments, the first one being the string that describes the group of test case suite, 

the second one being the function that has test cases or another nested `describe` function.

(Sometimes as our codes get more complicated, we need to organize our test cases better.
  
It is up to us to have nested `describe()`,

if we need more structure to our test cases,
 
we can create another nested `describe()` inside `describe()`.)

In this example above, its basic structure looks like this.

```js
describe('Person class', function() {
  // test cases go here
})
```

`it()` function actually tests case. It also takes two arguments,

the first one would be a description, and the second one is a function that tests the case.

```js
it('should have property', function() {
  const testPerson = new Person('testname');
  expect(testPerson).to.have.property('name');
});
```

this `it()` goes inside the `describe()` function.


### 4. Test the case.

We can test our code by typing

```
npm test
```

And it will show

either red, green color in the test.

```
> testing-folder@1.0.0 test
> mocha



  Person class
    ✔ should have name property


  1 passing (6ms)
```

In the test above, we can see `Person class` and `should have name property`.

They represent the first arugment in `describe()` and `it()` respectively.

After the test passing, we can also refactor our code further.

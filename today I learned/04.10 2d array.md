# 2D array (matirx)

#### [Question](#question), [Solution](#the-solution), [What I learned](#what-i-learned-is)

I encountered a question, 

## Question

```
Write a function maxColumn(matrix) that takes in a 2-dimensional array (matrix) and 

returns an array containing the maximum value in each column. 

The array length should be equal to the number of columns, such that returnArray[i] is equal to the max value in the ith column.
```

The question was to find the highest number in each column in matrix.

A matrix consists of nested arrays.

<em>matrix example</em>

```
[ [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9] ]
```

`1 2 3` would be row, `1 4 7` would be column.

I knew that it had to do with nested for loop, but

I couldn't figure it out how to find the biggest number in each column it 

so I looked at the [solution](#the-solution) out there.

## The solution

The solution sets the width, and height

The width would be matrix's first element's length `matrix[0].length`

The height would be matrix's length `matrix.length`.

```js
function maxColNum(matrix) {
    /*
    1. create variables matrix's width, and height
    2. create an empty array
    3. iterate through 'width'
        a. create a variable 'maxCol' intended to be the max col number, set it first at the current column number
        b. iterate through 'height' from the second from the top
            i. if the current height's column is higher than 'maxCol', then assign it to 'maxCol'
        c. add 'maxCol' to the empty array
    */
    let width = matrix[0].length;
    let height = matrix.length;
    let empty = [];

    for (let i=0;i<width;i++){ // i = 0, 1, 2
        
        
        let maxCol = matrix[0][i]; // maxcol = 13, 23, 42
        console.log(`maxCol ${maxCol}`)

        for (let j=1;j<height;j++){ // j = 1, 2
            
            console.log(`matrix[j][i] ${matrix[j][i]}`)

            console.log(`is maxtrix[j][i] bigger than maxCol ${matrix[j][i] > maxCol}`)

            if (matrix[j][i] > maxCol){
                
                maxCol = matrix[j][i];
            }
            
            console.log(`new maxCol ${maxCol}`)
        }
        empty.push(maxCol)
        console.log(`maxCol ${maxCol} is pushed to the array`)
        console.log('------------------------------------------')
    }
    return empty
}

console.log(maxColNum([[13,13,23],
                      [23,11,31],
                      [42,09,32]]))
```

The result would be

```
maxCol 13
matrix[j][i] 23
is maxtrix[j][i] bigger than maxCol true
new maxCol 23
matrix[j][i] 42
is maxtrix[j][i] bigger than maxCol true
new maxCol 42
maxCol 42 is pushed to the array
------------------------------------------
maxCol 13
matrix[j][i] 11
is maxtrix[j][i] bigger than maxCol false
new maxCol 13
matrix[j][i] 9
is maxtrix[j][i] bigger than maxCol false
new maxCol 13
maxCol 13 is pushed to the array
------------------------------------------
maxCol 23
matrix[j][i] 31
is maxtrix[j][i] bigger than maxCol true
new maxCol 31
matrix[j][i] 32
is maxtrix[j][i] bigger than maxCol true
new maxCol 32
maxCol 32 is pushed to the array
------------------------------------------
[ 42, 13, 32 ]
```

I went over to each line, and with `console.log()`, I made sure the variables display the value that I wanted it to.

## What I learned is

- I didn't know that we can visualize the matrix and set width and length. And it started to make sense.

- When we set the `maxCol`, the value is set to `matrix[0][i]`. I didn't know how to dynamically set the value of `maxCol` which means that depending on the `i`, maxCol's value changes. I learned that it is possible to dynamically set the value of any variables.

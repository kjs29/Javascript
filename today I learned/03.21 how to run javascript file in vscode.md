# How to run JS file in VScode

I am new to JavaScript, so I need to make sure that I can run JS file in VScode.

What I want is...

```
When the javascript file is focused, I want to run javascript file with "control+enter" key as if I type "node <currentfilename.js>" terminal. 

When python file is focused I want to run python file with the same "control+enter" key as if I type "python <currentfilename.py>" in terminal.
```

I have worked with python files in vscode, and I used "Control+return" for running the `.py` file.

So I wanted to use the same key binding to run the `.js` file.

First, I need to press 'command+p', type '>' and type 'Preferences: Open KeyBoard ShortCuts(JSON)'.

I made the shortcut key binding to it `command + S command + K`.

<em>Keyboard Shortcute(JSON)</em>

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+enter",
    "command": "python.execInTerminal"
},

{
    "key": "ctrl+enter",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
    "args": { "text": "node ${fileBasename}\u000D" },
    "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'javascript'"
}
```

The first one is for the Python key binding and the second is for Javascript file.

Now I can press `control + enter` to run either of Python or JS file in vscode.

Thing to keep in mind..

- If I run JS file in another terminal with different current working directory, it throws an error like the below. For example, I have a javascript file whose directory is `user/jinsung/Desktop/programming/javascript/new.js`, but when I run this file and the terminal's current working directory is set at `user/jinsung/aa-projects/first.js` then it throws an error.

    ```
    node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1042
    throw err;
    ^

    Error: Cannot find module '/Users/jinsung/Desktop/programming/javascript/first.js'

    code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
    requireStack: []
    }

    Node.js v18.13.0
    ```

- For Python key binding, I can run in any terminal regardless of their current working directories.

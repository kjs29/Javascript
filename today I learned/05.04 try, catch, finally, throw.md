# try, catch, finally, throw

There are errors that appear when things go wrong.

In JavaScript, there are two big categories of Errors.

- Syntax Errors

- Runtime Errors



Syntax Errors happen when syntax of JavaScript is wrong.

```js
console.looooog('hello world'); // SyntaxError
```


Runtime Errors happen when syntax is still correct.

There are different errors that fall under runtime errors.

```
ReferenceError: Thrown when a non-existent variable is referenced.

TypeError: Thrown when a value is not of the expected type or when attempting to call a non-function object as a function.

RangeError: Thrown when a value is outside the allowed range, such as an array index that is out of bounds.

URIError: Thrown when incorrect use of global URI handling functions, such as encodeURI() or decodeURI().

EvalError: Thrown when the global eval() function is used in an incorrect manner.
```

### try, catch are used to catch runtime errors

Basic usage of try and catch

```js
try {
    // we write codes that might contain errors

    // it it catches any error, the first error object is sent as argument in catch()
} catch(err) {
    
}
```

Practically, we would write like this.

```js
try {
    console.log('hello world!');

    errorFunction();
} catch(err) {
    console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
}
```

and we get

```
hello world!
Error: ReferenceError: errorFunction is not defined
```

we can add `finally`.

```js
try {
    console.log('hello world!');

    errorFunction();
} catch(err) {
    console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
} finally {
    console.log('this will print regardless');
}
```


```
hello world!
Error: ReferenceError: errorFunction is not defined
this will print regardless
```

We can also use `throw`.

let's take a look at this example.

```js
function divide(a, b) {
    if (b === 0) {
        throw new whatTheHeck('Cannot be divided by 0.')
    }
    return a / b;
}

try {
    let result = divide(20, 0);
} catch(err) {
    console.log(err.name);
    console.log(err.message);
}

```

```
ReferenceError
whatTheHeck is not defined
```

`err` object has name property and message property.

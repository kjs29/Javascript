# Reason why we should sometimes iterate from the last index position

Let's look at the example.

We want to remove 'l' alphabet from the array.

```js
let a = [ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' ];

for (let i=0;i<a.length;i++) {
    if (a[i] === "l" ) {
        a.splice(i,1)
    }
}

console.log(a)
```

However the result shows 

```
[ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'o' ]
```

That's not what we expected. We wanted `['h','e','o']`.

It shows like that because 

```
condition : (i < a.length)

when i = 0, condition is true, 'h' !== 'l'  // don't do anything
when i = 1, condition is true, 'e' !== 'l'  // don't do anything
when i = 2, condition is true, 'l' === 'l'  // it operates a.splice(2, 1)
----------------------- a changed to ['h','e','l','o'] ---------------------
when i = 3, condition is true, 'o' !== 'l'  // don't do anything
when i = 4, condition is false, break the loop
```

The array's length changed from `splice()` which affects the next iteration(`i`).

But when we iterate from the last index position, we get the desired result.

```js
let a = [ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' ];

for (let i=a.length-1;i>=0;i--) {
    if (a[i] === "l" ) {
        a.splice(i,1)
    }
}

console.log(a)  // ['h','e','o']
```

Let's break it down

```
condition : (i >= 0)

when i = 4, condition is true, 'o' !== 'l'  // don't do anything
when i = 3, condition is true, 'l' === 'l'  // it operates a.splice(3,1)
------------------a changed to ['h','e','l','o']--------------------------
when i = 2, condition is true, 'l' === 'l'  // it operates a.splice(2,1)
------------------a changed to ['h','e','o']------------------------------
when i = 1, condition is true, 'e' !== 'l'  // don't do anything
when i = 0, condition is true, 'h' === 'l'  // don't do anything
when i = -1, condition is false, break the loop
```

For this reason,

when modifying the length of an array in iteration, 

it is required to iterate from the last index position to the first.

# Most common array operations can be expressed as a combination of map(), filter(), reduce()

### This reading can be useful to find out when to use map, filter, or reduce.

Let's take a look at this example, 

We have an array `oneToFive`.

```js
let oneToFive = [1,2,3,4,5];
```

Adding all the numbers in an array can be written in one of these ways.

1.

```js
let oneToFive = [1,2,3,4,5];

let sum = 0;
for (let i=0;i<oneToFive.length;i++) {
    let eachNum = oneToFive[i];
    sum += eachNum;
}
console.log(sum);       // 15
```

2.

```js
let oneToFive = [1,2,3,4,5];

let sum = 0;
for (let eachNum of oneToFive) {
    sum += eachNum;
}
console.log(sum);       // 15
```

3.

```js
let oneToFive = [1,2,3,4,5];

let sum = 0;
for (let i in oneToFive) {
    let eachNum = oneToFive[i];
    sum += eachNum;
}
console.log(sum);           // 15
```

These 1,2,3 all have one common feature that is there is `sum` that keeps track of the total sum of each element as it iterates.

We call `sum` an accumulator.

# When we use an accumulator in traversing an array, we can use `reduce()`.

# Explanation for reduce()

`reduce()` is a method for array. It iterates through an array, and reduces each element in each iteration.

The basic syntax for `reduce()` is 

```
Array.reduce(callback, initialValue)
```

#### `callback` is a function to be run in each iteration.

`callback` function takes three parameters, `currentValue`, `accumulator`, and `currentIndex`.

#### `initialValue` is an initial value to be calculated before the first iteration begins.

When `initialValue` is 0, it adds 0 in the beginning.

Take a look at the example below.

```js
const callbackFunc = function(currentValue, accumulator, currentIndex){
    console.log(currentValue, accumulator, currentIndex);
    return currentValue + accumulator
}
const total = [1,2,3,4,5].reduce(callbackFunc, 0);
console.log(`total : ${total}`);
```

We see the output

```
0 1 0
1 2 1
3 3 2
6 4 3
10 5 4
total : 15
```

What does this output mean?

`visualization of how reduce works, maybe picture`

# Example of `reduce()`

```js
let oneToFive = [1,2,3,4,5];

// calculates the sum of each element in an array, assigns it to a variable 'total'
let total = oneToFive.reduce((eachNum, accum)=>eachNum + accum, 0);

console.log(total);         // 15
```

# Another example of `reduce()`.

We have an array called `numbers`.

```js
let numbers = [1,3,2,6,4,8,-5];

let maxNum = numbers.reduce((accum, el)=> {
  if (el > accum.max) {
    accum.max = el;
  }
  if (el < accum.min) {
    accum.min = el;
  }
  return accum;
}, {'max':-Infinity,'min':Infinity})

console.log(maxNum);        // { max: 8, min: -5 }
```

`reduce()` has two arguments, first is callback function.

The callback function is this anonymous function.

```js
(accum, el)=> {
  if (el > accum.max) {
    accum.max = el;
  }
  if (el < accum.min) {
    accum.min = el;
  }
  return accum;
}
```

The second argument in `reduce()` is `{'max':-Infinity,'min':Infinity}`, which is assigned to a variable `accum`.

The anonymous function has two parameters, `accum` and `el`.

In each iteration, the code snippet above is run, and at the end, `accum` is passed into the next iteration.


# Let's consider this scenario.

We have an array and we want to multiple by 2 to each element in an array.

We can achieve the desired outcome using different ways to traverse an array.

Let's take a look at this example below,

```js
let oneToFive = [1,2,3,4,5];

let doubleOneToFive = [];

for (let eachNum of oneToFive) {
    doubleOneToFive.push(eachNum * 2)
}
console.log(doubleOneToFive);
```

`doubleOneToFive` is created and an empty array is assigned,

And we iterated through the array `oneToFive`,

in each iteration, we added each element * 2 to `doubleOneToFive`.

# Sometimes we create a new array to solve questions, in that case, we can use `map()` method instead.

Let's take a look at the following example.

```js
let oneToFive = [1,2,3,4,5];
const doubleOneToFive = oneToFive.map(eachNum => eachNum * 2);

console.log(doubleOneToFive);       // [2,4,6,8,10]
```

Just like `reduce()`, `map()` also takes a callback function as the first parameter,

`eachNum` represents each element in an array.

In each iteration, `eachNum * 2` is added to an empty array, and the array is assigned to a variable `doubleOneToFive`.

# Let's take a look at the following example.

```js
let oneToFive = [1,2,3,4,5];

let lessThanFour = [];
for (let i=0;i<oneToFive.length;i++){
    let eachNum = oneToFive[i];
    if (eachNum < 4) {
        lessThanFour.push(eachNum);
    }
}

console.log(lessThanFour);          // [1,2,3]
```

Since we created a new array, we might think we can solve with `map()` but

```js
let oneToFive = [1,2,3,4,5];

let lessThanFour = oneToFive.map(eachNum => {
    if (eachNum < 4) {
        return eachNum;
    }
});

console.log(lessThanFour);          // [1, 2, 3, undefined, undefined]
```

We can't solve this with `map()` even if this example created a new array,

so this example can be solved with `filter()`.

Let's consider the next example.

```js
let oneToFive = [1,2,3,4,5];

let lessThanFour = oneToFive.filter(eachNum => {
    if (eachNum < 4) {
        return eachNum;
    }
});

console.log(lessThanFour);      // [1,2,3]
```

# When we might need to modify the length of an array, we use `filter()`.


# `filter()` method also takes a callback function as the first parameter.

callback function for both `map()`, and `filter()` takes

```
(value, index, array)
```

as its parameters.

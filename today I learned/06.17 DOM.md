In JavaScript, there is really important thing to know besides its syntax.

It is DOM Manipulation.

# What is a DOM?

DOM stands for Document Object Model.

JavaScript language was made for websites specifically.

And each web page is a document written in HTML.

With using JavaScript, we can traverse DOM, and also manipulate DOM.

HTML typcially looks like this.

```html
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <header></header>
        <main>
            <div>
                <h1></h1>
                <p></p>
            </div>
        </main>
        <footer></footer>
    </body>
</html>
```

All elements except for html element has parent element, and some parent element can have multiple child elements.

For example, div has two child elements h1, and p.

# It is important to know how to find the right element.

We can traverse the document using document.

Script is a program that browser runs, so we can use script tag either in html file, or in a separate file.

We can access h1 tag like this.

```js
let h1 = document.getElementById('h1');
```

now h1 represents the first h1 tag it appears in the file. 

The `getElementById()` methods returns the first element object that has the same id string as the argument.

There should be only one id in each file.

We can use other methods to select element(s).

```
querySelector()

getElementsByTagsName()

getElementsByClassName()

getElementById()

querySelector()

querySelectorAll()
```

They are the most popular methods to select element(s).

Also, we can use the following methods to find parent elements, child elements, etc.

```
parentNode

childrenNodes

firstElementChild

lastElementChild

nextElementSibling

previousElementSibling
```


# It is also important to manipulate DOM.

Let's consider the following example.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <h1>hello</h1>
        <code>hello</code>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

For example, if we want to change the code tag to `print('hello world')`, we can use the following example.

```js
let code = document.getElementsByTagName('code')[0];
code.textContent = 'print("hello world")';
```

And we can see that code element is changed to `print("hello world")`.

## Another example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        body {
            display: flex;
            height: 100vh;
        }

        .box {
            margin: auto;
            width: 400px;
            height: 400px;
            background: pink;
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            align-items: center;
            justify-content: center;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="box">
        <p>You have two choices</p>
        <p>You will become...</p>
        <h1 id="job">poor</h1>
        <button>click me</button>
    </div>
    <script>
    </script>
</body>
</html>

```

Now h1 tag has poor text inside, what should we do to change it to "rich" once we click the button?

Let's start.

```js
// select button
let button = document.getElementsByTagName('button')[0];

// select h1
let h1 = document.getElementById('job');

// once button is clicked, change h1 tag's text to 'rich'
button.addEventListener('click', ()=>{
    h1.textContent = 'rich';
});
```

We can use addEventListener to manipulate events.

# How to create an element?

We have a simple document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <h1>DOM</h1>
        <p>Traverse the DOM</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

If we want to add `<p>Manipulate the DOM</p>`, then we can add the following code.

```js
let div = document.getElementsByTagName('div')[0];

let p = document.createElement('p');
p.textContent = "Manipulate the DOM";

div.appendChild(p);
```

# Another Example

Let's take a look at this example. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="keyLog"></h1>
</body>
</html>
```

We want the h1 to appear "Up pressed" if Up Key arrow is pressed.

"Down pressed" if Down Key arrow is pressed.

Same goes for left and right keys.

```js
<script>
    let key = document.getElementById('keyLog');
    
    document.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
        
        switch (event.key) {
            case 'ArrowUp':
                key.textContent = "Up pressed";
                break;
            case 'ArrowDown':
                key.textContent = "Down pressed";
                break;
            case 'ArrowRight':
                key.textContent = "Right pressed";
                break;
            case 'ArrowLeft':
                key.textContent = "Left pressed";
                break;
        }
    });
</script>
```

We can write addEventListener to document(the entire html file), and add keydown type.

# How to style an element

Changing style of an element takes an important role in DOM manipulation.

Try adding, removing, toggling class instead of adding an inline css style.

<em>Example of inline styling</em>

```js
let h1 = document.querySelector('h1');

h1.style.color = 'red';
h1.style.fontSize = '6rem';
```

We can add class to achieve the same, this will result in cleaner code, because we can put all the stylings to css file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        .red {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p id="paragraph">hello world</p>
    <button>click me</button>
</body>
</html>
```

We could use inline styling, but we can also try to write our script like this below.

```js
let p = document.getElementById('paragraph');
let button = document.getElementsByTagName('button')[0];

button.addEventListener('click', event => {
    p.classList.add('red');
});
```

Thankfully javaScript has built-in toggle method, so we can use it like a on-off switch.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        .red {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p id="paragraph">hello world</p>
    <button>click me</button>
    <script>
        let p = document.getElementById('paragraph');
        let button = document.getElementsByTagName('button')[0];

        button.addEventListener('click', event => {
            
            // replace add with toggle
            p.classList.toggle('red');
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```



Important things to keep in mind

```
Performance: Keep in mind that every time you make changes to the DOM, the browser may need to recalculate the layout, repaint or composite the page. This can be expensive and lead to performance issues. Therefore, try to minimize the number of changes you make to the DOM.

Avoid Global Queries: Methods such as document.querySelectorAll or document.getElementById can be expensive, as they traverse the entire DOM tree. Use them sparingly and prefer more targeted queries, such as using element.querySelector.

Batch DOM Changes: Instead of making one change at a time, make all of your changes at once. This can reduce the number of reflows and repaints that the browser needs to do.

Use Document Fragments: When you need to create a lot of elements at once, consider using a DocumentFragment. You can append nodes to it, and then append the entire fragment to the DOM. This only triggers a single reflow, rather than one for each node.

Use Event Delegation: Instead of attaching event handlers to individual elements, consider attaching them to a parent element and using event propagation to handle events on child elements. This can reduce memory usage and improve performance.

Be Aware of Asynchronous Behavior: JavaScript is single-threaded, but many APIs like setTimeout, setInterval, and AJAX calls (fetch, axios) are asynchronous and may not execute in the order you expect.

Be Careful with innerHTML: Overuse of innerHTML can lead to performance issues, as it causes the browser to serialize the DOM tree into a string, parse the new string of HTML you've provided, and regenerate the DOM tree. It also opens up the possibility for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Always sanitize user input if you have to use innerHTML.

Don't Forget Accessibility: As you manipulate the DOM, ensure you're still following best practices for web accessibility. For example, if you dynamically add content, consider how this will work with screen readers and other assistive technologies.

Clean up Event Listeners: If you're adding event listeners to elements that will be removed from the DOM, always remember to remove the listeners as well, otherwise they can cause memory leaks.

Manipulating Styles: Try to manipulate classes (adding, removing, toggling) instead of inline styles. This will keep your JS code clean and styles separate in CSS.

Cross Browser Compatibility: Not all browsers interpret JavaScript in the same way. This can lead to some features working in one browser but not in another. Consider using feature detection or a service like Babel to ensure your code works across different browsers.

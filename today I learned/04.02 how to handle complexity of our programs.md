# How to handle uncontrolled complexity of our programs?

```
The computing scientist’s main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making.

There are two ideas that can help us.

[Abstraction](#abstraction)

# Importance of Decomposition

Decomposition is a process of breaking down a larger problem into its smaller sub problems.

Benefits of decomposition

- More readable

- Easier to maintain

- Less prone to errors

<em>A reason why we should use decomposition - Take a look at the code snippet below</em>

```js
// Write a function laligatSum(n) that takes in a number and returns the 
// laligatSum of that number. 
// A number's laligat sum is the the sum of all the prime numbers less than or 
// equal to that number.
// laligatSum(10) should return 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17
// laligatSum(11) should return 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 28


function laligatSum(n) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i += 1) {
    let prime = true;

    for (let factor = 2; factor < i; factor += 1) {
      if (i % factor === 0) {
        prime = false;
        break;
      }
    }

    if (prime) {
      sum += i;
    }
  }
  return sum;
}
```

The code above is messy and hard to understand. 

What if it contained a bug? Would I be able to debug?

We can decompose the function and it looks like the code below.

```js
// Nice and Decomposed:
function isPrime(n) {
  for (let i = 2; i  < n; i += 1) {
    if (n % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}

function laligatSum(n) {
  let sum = 0;

  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i += 1) {
    if (isPrime(i)) { // if i is a prime,
      sum += i;       // then add it to sum.
    }
  }

  return sum;
}
```

We decomposed the first function, and we created a helper function `isPrime`.

About when to decompose a hard problem into helper functions is up to our judgment.

For example, in the case above, we were uncertain about the prime number so we created another helper function `isPrime`.

Good tips on decomposition

- Make function do a particular task. Single task. Make a function modular.

- Read other people's codes

- If a function I wrote is large and difficult to follow, consider decomposing by creating a helper function.

# Abstraction

Abstraction involves the process of hiding details.

Abstraction allows us to focus on what we need to focus so that programmers are not distracted by unimportant things.

For example, when we drive a car, we need to know how to read signs, how to use brakes, accelerator etc.

Similarly in programming, we can use abstractions to hide some details of how code works.

<em>Not used abstractions</em>

```js
let temperature = 25;
let convertedTemperature = (temperature * 9/5) + 32;
console.log(`The temperature ${temperature}°C is equal to ${convertedTemperature}°F`);

temperature = 77;
convertedTemperature = (temperature - 32) * 5/9;
console.log(`The temperature ${temperature}°F is equal to ${convertedTemperature}°C`);
```

The code above is hard to read and understand because the formulas are mixed in with the rest of the code.

Additionally we won't be able to reuse this code again in other part of the program.

<em>Used abstractions</em>

```js
function celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius) {
  return (celsius * 9/5) + 32;
}

function fahrenheitToCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9;
}

let temperature = 25;
let convertedTemperature = celsiusToFahrenheit(temperature);
console.log(`The temperature ${temperature}°C is equal to ${convertedTemperature}°F`);

temperature = 77;
convertedTemperature = fahrenheitToCelsius(temperature);
console.log(`The temperature ${temperature}°F is equal to ${convertedTemperature}°C`);
```

In the code above, we can reuse the `celsiusToFahrenheit` and `fahrenheitToCelsius` in anywhere.

It hides the details of the calculation inside the functions code block, so we just need to care about providing either `celsius` or `fahrenheit`.

<em>Another example without abstraction</em>

```js
let length = 10;
let width = 5;
let area = length * width;
let perimeter = 2 * (length + width);
console.log(`The area of the rectangle is ${area}`);
console.log(`The perimeter of the rectangle is ${perimeter}`);
```

<em>With abstraction</em>

```js
function calculateRectangleArea(width, height) {
    return width * height;
}

function calculateRectanglePerimeter(width, height) {
    return 2 * (width + height);
}

let length = 10;
let width = 5;
let area = calculateRectangleArea(length, width);
let perimeter = calculateRectanglePerimeter(length, width);
console.log(`The area of the rectangle is ${area}`);
console.log(`The perimeter of the rectangle is ${perimeter}`);
```

In the example of abstraction above, we don't need to know what mathematical operations are being used or how rectangle's area is calculated, as the calculation of an area of rectangle is being performed inside the function or it hides the details, all we have to care about is the input parameters and the output it returns.
